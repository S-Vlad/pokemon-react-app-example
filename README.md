# React + TypeScript + Vite

The code provided in the project shows my everyday style. This is a simple responsive app that allows users to browse **Pokemon** characters using the [API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) and persist search query in URL. The app consists of two pages: the "Home/Search" page and the "Details" page. The Home page features a search input field with a filtered list of results displayed below it. The Details page shows information about a specific character.
